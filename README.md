# Learning Objectives
After completing our tutorial sequence, students should be able to:
1. Design and build functioning circuits that incorporate an Arduino, as well as components like switches, lights, and sensors
2. Write "Arduino Sketches" (programs) for their circuits that collect data and log it for later retrieval
3. Troubleshoot issues with their circuit wiring, if any should occur
4. Debug their Arduino Sketches, if they malfunction or don't work as expected
# What to Cover
Heavily integrate the Autodesk Circuit Designer.
Include a link to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL34zDTPkcs), as a quick introduction for more impatient students.
